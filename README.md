# Files manager 
Understanding the Requirements
This project involves building a file management system that uses Redis, MongoDB, and Node.js. The first task is to create a utility for interacting with Redis.

What is Redis?
Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used as:

A cache to store temporary data.
A key-value store for quick data access.
A messaging system for tasks like background processing.
